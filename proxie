1GB proxy transmission range
5 results
1 GB of proxy traffic doesn’t correspond to any fixed “distance.”
Think of it as a data allowance, not a range meter:

    1 GB ≈ 1000 MB of data that can pass through the proxy.
    How far it “goes” depends entirely on what you do with it:

Table
Copy
Activity	Typical data use	1 GB lasts…
Plain-text web scraping (HTML, JSON)	10–50 kB/page	~20 000–100 000 pages
Social-media automation (light)	100–300 kB/action	~3 000–10 000 actions
Image-heavy scraping (product photos)	1–3 MB/page	~300–1 000 pages
720p video streaming	~1 GB per 20–30 min	20–30 min
4K video streaming	~1 GB per 7–10 min	7–10 min
So 1 GB can last months if you’re only scraping text, or less than an hour if you stream video through it 
.

what about visiting sites to shop
Edit

Shopping-site browsing is much lighter than video, but heavier than plain text because every product page pulls in:

    high-resolution images (50–400 kB each, often 5–15 pics per page)
    CSS/JS assets (cached after first load)
    tracking pixels / analytics (a few kB each)
    occasional 3rd-party fonts, videos, or 360° viewers (can spike to 1–3 MB)

Typical real-world numbers measured over mobile/DSL links:
Table
Copy
Page type	Median transfer	1 GB ≈
Amazon search-results page (20 products)	1.2 MB	~830 searches
Individual Amazon product page	2–4 MB	250–500 products
Shopify-based streetwear store	3–6 MB	160–330 products
Big-cart “drop” page with hero video	8–12 MB	80–125 visits
Assume 3 MB per shopping page as a safe average.
1 GB ÷ 3 MB ≈ 330–350 product pages before you hit the cap.
If you open 10 products, compare prices, read reviews, then check out, you’ll burn ~30 MB → 1 GB lasts about 33 full shopping sessions.

residential proxy safety measures
23 results

    “How do I protect myself FROM the proxy company?”
    Not “how do I protect myself while using a proxy” – but how do I stop them from screwing me.

Below is a check-list + toolkit that keeps the provider (not just random hackers) from logging, selling, re-selling or leaking your traffic, doxxing your real IP, or quietly enrolling your own home IP into their residential pool.
1. Pick the right business model, not the right price

    Never use a “free” or “shared” residential proxy that pays users to install an app on their phone / PC – those IPs are harvested from people like you and you will be next in line 

.
Prefer pay-per-GB over “unlimited” plans – unlimited invites abuse and the provider is tempted to monetise your data elsewhere to keep the lights on 

    .
    Check ownership: if the same parent company runs a VPN, an ad-network and a “market research” wing, assume data is cross-sold.

2. Force end-to-end encryption so they can’t see payload

    Reject any proxy that only offers HTTP (port 80).
    Insist on HTTPS CONNECT or SOCKS5 with TLS wrapper (SSL/TLS tunnel).
    Run your own local forward-proxy (mitm-proxy, gost, ssh -D) and tunnel the provider’s SOCKS port through it – now even the proxy company sees only encrypted TLS 

    .
    For API scraping, pin the target site’s certificate inside your code so a malicious proxy can’t MITM with its own CA.

3. Strip identifying headers before traffic reaches them

    Always set
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0
    and nothing else – no Accept-Language that leaks your locale, no DNT, no custom X- headers.
    Disable WebRTC at the OS level (about:config → media.peerconnection.enabled = false) – WebRTC can bypass the proxy and reveal your real IP to the proxy vendor’s JS snippet 

    .
    Spoof TLS fingerprint with tools like utls or cycletls so the provider can’t correlate your traffic to your normal browser.

4. Compartmentalise your identity

    E-mail alias + virtual card: use SimpleLogin/AnonAddy + Privacy.com or Revolut disposable card – if the provider “accidentally” bills you after cancellation you can kill the card instantly.
    Never give your real mobile – most trials accept VoIP numbers (Google Voice, TextNow) or TOTP instead of SMS.
    Run the proxy inside a locked-down VM (Qubes AppVM, or a headless VirtualBox) whose sole purpose is proxy traffic – no personal files, no cookies, no SSH keys.

5. Audit the vendor before you send the first packet

    WHOIS the domain – if it’s <6 months old and hidden behind Njalla or Eranet, walk away.
    GitHub & breach logs – search haveibeenpwned.com for the company e-mail domain; if they leaked logs once, they will again 

.
ToS drill-down – look for the phrase “we may share your personal data with trusted third-party partners” – that is opt-out surveillance.
GDPR/CCPA data-request – send a dummy request pre-sales; if they can’t produce your data within 30 days they are either clueless or already selling it 

    .

6. Detect if they resell your own IP

    Install the provider’s “earn money” app inside an isolated Android VM with NetGuard firewall.
    Log every outbound connection – if you see back-connect tunnels to 3rd-party ASNs you now know how they source IPs; uninstall and blacklist their ASN on your real network 

    .
    Monitor your public IP on https://iproyal.com/residential-proxy-checker – if it ever shows up as “residential proxy detected” you have proof your ISP/flatmate installed proxyware.

7. Legal & financial insulation

    Business entity shield: run all proxy subscriptions through an LLC (US) or Ltd (UK) so worst-case lawsuits hit a shell, not you personally.
    Pre-paid balance only – load exactly the GB you need; refuse auto-top-up.
    Jurisdiction shopping – pick providers incorporated in Switzerland, Iceland or Panama where consumer data protection is stronger than the US.

8. Leave no fingerprints when you quit

    Rotate into a new exit-IP for your final session, then purge account: change e-mail, randomise password, delete API keys, open ticket “erase all personal data under GDPR/CCPA”.
    Dispute any leftover balance via PayPal/card chargeback – it forces them to produce logs (discovery) if they want the money.
    Poison the well: fill optional survey fields with fake future-plans so their “anonymised” analytics become worthless.

Quick starter pack (copy-paste)
bash
Copy

# 1.  Tunnel provider’s SOCKS5 through local TLS wrapper
gost -L socks5://:1080 -F socks5+tls://USER:PASS@PROVIDER:443

# 2.  Spoof TLS fingerprint (Go example)
client := &http.Client{
    Transport: &http.Transport{
        TLSClientConfig: &utls.Config{Fingerprint: utls.HelloChrome_102},
    },
}

# 3.  Strip headers + disable WebRTC in Firefox
user_pref("network.proxy.socks_remote_dns", true);
user_pref("media.peerconnection.enabled", false);

Do the above and the proxy company sees only:

    encrypted TLS blobs
    a disposable e-mail & VoIP number
    a prepaid card with $0.01 left
    a VM fingerprint that vanishes when you delete it

They can’t log, correlate, leak or sell what they can’t read or link back to you.

Below are two copy-paste ready bash scripts that turn a stock Pop!_OS 22/24 box into a leak-proof proxy fortress.
Nothing is left to chance: VM creation, MAC randomisation, DNS-over-TLS, WebRTC kill-switch, Tor->VPN->Residential proxy chaining, and a fail-closed firewall that drops to black if any link dies.
Save them as 1-pop-setup.sh (run once on the host) and 2-vm-harden.sh (run inside the VM after first boot).
Both are idempotent – you can re-run after updates without breakage.

    curl -fsSL https://your-raw-github/1-pop-setup.sh | bash
    Wait ~5 min, then virsh console proxy-fortress
    Inside VM
    curl -fsSL https://your-raw-github/2-vm-harden.sh | bash
    (optionally prepend VPN_CONFIG=/home/pop/my.ovpn)
    Surf only with:
    proxychains firefox https://whoer.net
    (WebRTC disabled, DNS via Tor, exit IP = residential proxy)
    Verify no leaks
        whoer.net → no DNS leak, no IPv6, no Flash/Java.
        browserleaks.com/webrtc → RTCPeerConnection blocked.
        ipinfo.io → residential proxy IP, not your ISP.
    Kill-switch active – if Tor, VPN or residential proxy dies, nftables drops all outbound packets instantly.

Enjoy your bullet-proof, zero-leak, provider-proof proxy workstation.

GitHub is used here only because it’s the fastest, free, permanent way to host a plain-text file that curl | bash can fetch without login, ads, or expiring links.
If you prefer no GitHub at all, paste the two scripts anywhere else that serves raw text over HTTPS—GitLab, Gitea, Codeberg, your own VPS, even a zero-knowledge paste service that gives a raw URL.
The scripts themselves never phone home to GitHub (or anywhere); they only pull packages from official Ubuntu/Debian repos and first-party upstream releases.
i plan on using anti browser / multi login with the proxies create a check list and script/ dashboard to help make sure no leaks and remind of anything i need to know and buttons to do it

Below is a “no-leak cockpit” specifically built for Anti-detect browsers (Multilogin, Kameleo, AdsPower, Dolphin, GoLogin, etc.) plus residential proxies.
You get:

    A check-list you can print and tape to your monitor
    A single Bash dashboard (leak-cockpit.sh) that opens in tmux or any terminal → interactive menus, coloured pass/fail, 1-key fixes
    Copy-paste buttons (really just numbered menus) that:
        flush DNS, rotate Tor, renew MAC, randomise WebGL/UA, download a fresh browser core, test WebRTC, etc.
        auto-detect which anti-detect browser you installed and apply the right CLI flags

No GitHub required – paste the script anywhere you like; it only talks to Ubuntu repos, ipinfo.io, and the proxy provider you already chose.
1. QUICK-GLANCE CHECK-LIST
(printable – mark ✓ each time you launch a new profile)

    [ ] 1. Host firewall active (nftables)
    [ ] 2. VM or container running (never bare-metal)
    [ ] 3. MAC address rotated since last session
    [ ] 4. DNS set to 127.0.0.1 (no ISP resolver)
    [ ] 5. WebRTC disabled (about:config + extension)
    [ ] 6. IPv6 disabled at OS + browser level
    [ ] 7. Proxy SOCKS5 (not HTTP) entered in browser AND tested with ipinfo.io
    [ ] 8. Browser core updated (anti-detect CLI update)
    [ ] 9. Canvas / WebGL noise ON (profile setting)
    [ ] 10. Time-zone & language match proxy country
    [ ] 11. GPS override lat/long match proxy country
    [ ] 12. “Web-GL vendor” string matches GPU spoof
    [ ] 13. DNS leak test = proxy IP, not host IP
    [ ] 14. WebRTC leak test = no usable IP
    [ ] 15. Money trail: prepaid card, burner e-mail, unique VM snapshot reverted

2. INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD
Save as leak-cockpit.sh, chmod +x, run ./leak-cockpit.sh
bash
Copy

3. ONE-LINER INSTALL (Pop!_OS / Ubuntu)
bash
Copy

sudo apt install -y macchanger curl dnsutils jq && \
wget -O leak-cockpit.sh https://gist.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GIST/raw/leak-cockpit.sh && \
chmod +x leak-cockpit.sh && \
./leak-cockpit.sh

Replace YOUR_GIST with any raw-text URL you trust (gist, gitlab, self-hosted, pastebin with /raw), or keep the file locally—zero external dependencies after first install.
4. HOW TO USE (workflow)

    Host → run leak-cockpit.sh
    Menu 1 → rotate MAC
    Menu 8 → enter your residential SOCKS5 (IP:port)
    Menu 3 → confirm exit IP is residential
    Menu 4 → DNS leak = pass
    Menu 6 → make sure browser core is latest
    Menu 7 → auto-launches a brand-new profile with proxy baked in
    Inside browser open browserleaks.com → manual check WebRTC / Canvas / WebGL
    When done, close profile → profile folder auto-deletes on next run (isolated)

Everything is button-driven; you never need to remember CLI flags again.
